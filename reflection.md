- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affects your programming?
To be honest, my initial impressions are that it is very confusing and adds an extra complicated layer. It is cool, though, to keep things organized among different classes, but there is SO much to think about and keep track of. It's overwhelming, but it is cool. Especially because classes are related, you really have to think about what responsibilities belong where.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I would advise someone to ask questions earlier. I was confused about exceptions/try/catch for a little while, but didn't really ask for clarification until I went to office hours to work on the assignment. Ask questions in class, but if you're still confused or don't get to ask, you can ask conceptual questions in office hours. It doesn't just have to be specific assignment questions. 

It is working for me to go to office hours and TA hours several times. I like to go even when I don't have a specific question. I just get started and try to get my bearings by myself, but then if I'm confused, I can ask a question right then. It is also really helpful to use all the resources available. Sometimes I would watch the video and forget the README existed, so referring back to that when I remembered it was super helpful.

As always, it doesn't work to start the assignment the night it's due. Give yourself time. I've been giving myself more time, but I wish I would even start a day or two earlier just to get familiar with it and get thinking.
